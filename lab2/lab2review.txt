Correctness:

- The fact that you created a package (which you were not asked to) makes it
  impossible to run the program as specified in the handout, that is:
$ java driverDFA gncgwng

- Even running it as a package (I should not), it produces an error:
$ java lab2.driverDFA
Enter a solution: 
gncgwng
Error: Invalid Input n
 

Style:

- Both files have major style problems. You are not following the style
  guidelines.

- Incorrect indentation in both the driver and ManWolf files. Please use a
  two-space indentation.

- Good block comments

- Both files are missing the header. Remember: Each file must have a block
  comment at the top which gives the name of the file, the student's name, the
  assignment, the date, the version, and a comment about what is contained in
  the file. For example:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 * 
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */

- Classes do not have a description. Each class declaration must have a comment
  block before it, which gives the class name and describes the purpose of the
  class. Here is an example:
/**
 * SinglyLinkedList
 * 
 * This class implements a linked list with single forward links, and supports
 * dynamic addition and deletion of nodes. 
 */
public class SinglyLinkedList {
  // ...
}


Efficiency and Other Comments:

- Program seems efficient as implemented.

- Avoid using packages, it makes it harder for me to grade. It is in your best
  interest that it is easier for me to grade your work.


CSV files:

- CSV files contain State-transition table and description of states.

- In the State-transition table the items on the left should correspond to the
  states, e.g., q0, q1, etc.
